# Summary 
#we present here an example of how to produce a benchmarking as described in: Benchmarking Derivative-Free Optimization Algorithms Jorge J. More' and Stefan M. Wild SIAM J. Optimization, Vol. 20 (1), pp.172-191, 2009.
#
#The latest version of this subroutine is always available at http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~more/dfo/ The authors would appreciate feedback and experiences from numerical studies conducted using this subroutine.
#
#Performance profiles were originally introduced in Benchmarking optimization software with performance profiles, E.D. Dolan and J.J. More', Mathematical Programming, 91 (2002), 201--213.
